      <p>I have spent most of my adult life dedicating my time to practicing Brazilian Jiujitsu, but as I get older my time in competition is drawing to and end.  
        Because of this I am taking it upon myself to build some skills in the world of coding so I have another outlet for my creativity and so I can open a gym of my own.
